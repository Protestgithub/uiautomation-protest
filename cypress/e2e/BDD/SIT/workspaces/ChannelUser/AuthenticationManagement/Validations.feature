Scenario:"To verify that following general rules apply to userâ€™s PIN (applicable for both mPIN and tPIN): 
PIN Should not be sequential i.e. no two consecutive digits should be sequential for example PIN like 2379, 9862 are not allowed.
PIN Should not consist of any duplicate number i.e. there should not be any repetitive number in the PIN for example PIN like 1139, 2452 are not allowed.
PIN Length of the PIN should be made configurable, as per ISO 9564 guidelines of PIN Code management, the length of PIN should not be less than 4 digits and more than 12 digits (although upto 6 digits is ideal from usability perspective).
 All mobiquity money users or customers will have same length of PIN ( as per value defined in the configurable preference PIN_LENGTH)
o PIN_MIN_LENGTH and PIN_MAX_LENGTH would not be allowed to be modified but this will be displayed on preferences screen. These two values would be set in factory settings.
o Due to security reasons, value of DEFAULT_PIN and DEFAULT_PASSWORD will not be displayed on preferences screen. However, value of these preferences can be modified."
